    <h3>About</h3> 
    <p style="background: #dddddd; padding: 15px">
      Tiana Breeze is a Belarusian-Polish artist.
      She always knew what she wanted to be, but her journey to her dream was a long one.
    </p><p style="background: #98a8aa; padding: 15px; color:#fff">
      Tiana's creative talent manifested itself early, and by the age of 13, she was collaborating with nearly all the editorial offices of newspapers and magazines that published her humorous drawings. She participated in exhibitions and won competitions for caricature artists.
      Tiana studied fine arts at Vitebsk State University. She completed her graduation project in the oil painting studio under the supervision of Professor Anatoly Chmil and defended it with honors.
    </p><p style="background: #dddddd; padding: 15px">
      After graduating from university, for practical reasons, Tiana changed her decision and became a manager after two years of studies at a technological university. Although her career was progressing well and she became the head of a bank, she later realized that this was not what she truly wanted.
    </p><p style="background: #879597; padding: 15px; color: #fff">
      Moving to Poland, the homeland of her father, allowed Tiana to reassess her life and return to painting. She is now a full-time professional artist and is happy to be doing what she loves.
      Tiana is a member of the Union of Polish Artists, Painters, and Graphic Designers. Her works are in private collections in the USA, the UK, Germany, Belarus, Poland, and other countries.

    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
    <p style="background: #dddddd; padding: 15px">
      The element of water occupies a central place in my work. It has the ability to refract light, blur boundaries, and create an illusion of reality that lies on the edge of abstraction.
      Water is never the same — just like human emotions, memories, and experiences. It is this fluidity and impermanence that captivate me, driving me to constantly seek new ways to convey its living essence on the canvas.
      I work in a layered oil painting technique that allows me to achieve complex color nuances and depth. Reflections, optical effects, and the interaction of light with the water's surface become not just subjects, but means of expression. They allow me to go beyond literal representation, creating a space filled with air, movement, and emotion.
      I am fascinated by how objects transform in water, dissolve, and take on new forms. It is a view of the world not directly, but through its reflection, which makes the perception deeper, more intriguing, urging one to look closer and search for new meanings.
      Each of my works is the result of both external and internal journeys. In my paintings, I capture not only the moment, but its emotional resonance, allowing the viewer to experience that instant and feel its uniqueness.

    <h3>Technique</h3>
    <p style="background: #dddddd; padding: 15px">
      My paintings are created using traditional oil painting techniques on canvas stretched over a frame. My art education is rooted in classical academic painting, which forms a solid foundation for my creative work. I believe that the most important step in art is mastering the fundamentals, after which comes the freedom of self-expression and experimentation.
      Oil paints are my ideal medium for creating deep and expressive paintings. Oil allows me to achieve not only durability but also to convey the subtlest nuances of light and color. It is perfect for layered painting, which I use in my work to create soft transitions and smooth color gradations. This medium offers a richness of hues and incredible depth that cannot always be achieved with other materials.
      My style can be described as a combination of realism and impressionism with elements of abstraction, giving my paintings lightness and freedom. I strive to blend traditional techniques with a contemporary perspective on marine themes, creating works that maintain a connection to the past while living in the present. As a modern artist, I seek a balance between classical canons and current artistic expression.
