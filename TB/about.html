    <p class="about-text" data-i18n="aboutParagraph1" style="max-width: 60%; margin-top: 3%;"><br>My name is Tiana Breeze and I am a Belarusian-Polish artist, born in 1982 in Vitebsk, Belarus. My mother is Belarusian, and my father is Polish. We often went to Poland to visit my father's relatives. In 2017, my family and I moved to Poland for permanent residence, where I live and create to this day. 
			<br></br>I have been drawing since childhood and initially became famous in my country as a caricaturist. Since the age of 13, my drawings have already been published in magazines and newspapers, such as "Vecherniy Vitebsk", Vitebsk Worker, Vitbichi, Picnic, Vozhyk, Shapoklyak and others.
        			</p> <p class="about-text-1" data-i18n="aboutParagraph2">`I have held five solo exhibitions. I am a winner of the regional cartoon competition. I love satire and caricatures, but later my real passion became oil painting.
			<br><br></br>I graduated from the Faculty of Fine Arts and Graphics at the State University in Vitebsk. I completed my diploma artwork in the oil painting studio under the guidance of prof. Anatoly Chmil and defended it with honors. I found oil painting to be the best technique to channel my creative passion. 
		</br>
        
        <br>Because of some rational reasons I changed my decision and became a manager  after two years at the Vitebsk State Technological University with a degree in manager-economist. Although my career was going well, I later realized that it was not what I really wanted.
			Moving to Poland, my father's homeland, allowed me to continue painting. Now I am a professional full-time artist and I am happy to be able to do what I love.
		</br><br>I am a member of the Union of Polish Artists, Painters and Graphic Artists. My artworks are featured in private collections in the USA, UK, Germany, Belarus, Poland and others.`,

    <img src="imgs/about-2.jpg" class="about-tiana-img-2" style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; background: #e0e0e0; box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); padding: 5px;">
    <p class="about-art-text">

        <br>Art is my life and passion. They say that to find your style as an artist, you need to find what you love. I am a sea romantic and I love everything that is connected with the sea. I am fascinated by how different it can be. Sea can convey the whole range of feelings: from complete calm and peace to a storm and raging waves. Water can heal and destroy. I like to balance between these two states and paint pictures in accordance with my emotional experiences. 
		</br>
        
        <br>I like to watch how the lighting on the sea changes, how the color of the boat is reflected in the water, how the glare of the sun flickers on the waves. The play of light and color. And also the spirit of freedom, wind, freshness and sea breeze!  Breathtaking, isn't it?..
		</br>
        </p><p class="about-text-1">
        <br>Traveling on a yacht is always an endless feeling of freedom and unity with nature. When you look at the sea wave, everything becomes unimportant. It is pure meditation. As if in the whole world there is only you and this majestic beauty. I convey all my love for the sea, yachts, ships, marine life through my paintings. My paintings are like a sea breeze - fresh, light and dreamy.
