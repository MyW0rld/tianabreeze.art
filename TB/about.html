I am a Belarusian-Polish artist.
I have always known who I wanted to be — but the path to my dream was a long one.
My artistic talent began to show quite early, and by the age of 13, I was already working with nearly all the newspaper and magazine editorial offices that published my humorous drawings.
I participated in exhibitions and won caricature artist competitions.

I studied Fine Art at Vitebsk State University.
I completed my diploma work in the oil painting studio under the guidance of Prof. Anatoliy Chmil and graduated with honors.
I discovered that oil painting was the best medium for channeling my creative passion.

For some practical reasons, I changed my direction and became a manager after two years of studying management and economics at a technological university.
Although my career was going well — I even became a bank manager — I eventually realized that it was not what I truly wanted.
Moving to Poland, my father's homeland, allowed me to rethink my life and return to painting.

Now I am a full-time professional artist, and I’m happy to be doing what I love.
Tiana is a member of the Union of Polish Artists, Painters, and Graphic Artists.
Her works are held in private collections in the USA, UK, Germany, Belarus, Poland, and other countries.

    <img src="imgs/about-2.jpg" class="about-tiana-img-2" style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; background: #e0e0e0; box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); padding: 5px;">
    <p class="about-art-text">

        The elemen t of water occupies a central place in my art.
It has the power to refract light, blur boundaries, and create an illusion of reality that teeters on the edge of abstraction.
Water is never the same — just like human emotions, memories, and experiences. It is this fluidity and impermanence that attract me, compelling me to search again and again for new ways to convey its living essence on canvas.

I work with a multilayered oil painting technique, which allows me to achieve complex color nuances and depth.
Reflections, optical effects, and the interaction of light with the surface of water become more than just subjects — they are means of expression. They allow me to go beyond literal depiction, creating a space filled with air, movement, and emotion.

I am fascinated by how objects transform in water, dissolve, and take on new forms.
It is a view of the world not directly, but through its reflection — a perspective that makes perception deeper, more intriguing, prompting the viewer to look closer and search for new meanings.

Each of my works is the result of a journey — both external and internal.
In my paintings, I capture not only a moment but also its emotional resonance, allowing the viewer to experience it and feel its uniqueness.

For those who seek depth.
For those who never stop.
For those who want to feel.

    <h1 class="about-title2">My Technique</h1>
    <p class="about-art-text">

My paintings are created using the traditional technique of oil painting on canvas stretched over a stretcher frame.
My artistic education is based on classical academic painting, which forms a solid foundation for my work.
I believe that the most important step in art is mastering the basics — only then can true freedom of expression and experimentation begin.

Oil paints are my ideal medium for creating deep and expressive artworks.
Oil allows me to achieve not only durability but also to convey the subtlest nuances of light and color. It is perfect for the multilayered painting technique I use, creating soft transitions and smooth color gradients. This medium offers a richness of shades and incredible depth that other materials cannot always provide.

My style can be described as a combination of realism and impressionism with elements of abstraction, which gives my paintings lightness and freedom.
I strive to combine traditional technique with a contemporary view of the marine theme, creating works that remain connected to the past but live in the present.
As a modern artist, I seek a balance between classical principles and contemporary artistic expression.
