    <p class="about-text">

        <br>Tiana is an artist from Wroclaw known for her captivating impressionistic seascapes, images of boats, yachts and beach life. Art is her life and passion.</br>
        
        <br>She is a graduate from Department of Art and Graphics Design, P.M. Masherov Vitebsk State University.</br>
        
        <br>Tiana found oil painting to be the best technique to channel her creative passion. She likes to paint in the style of realism with notes of impressionism and expressionism. In her paintings, abstract or impressionistic backgrounds, applied with a palette knife or brush, are combined with realistic subjects, detailed in textural strokes.</br>

        <br>Hallmark of Tiana's works are positive energy and maritime mood. She takes inspiration from  traveling on a yacht which is full of adventure, an endless feeling of freedom and strong connection with nature.</br>
        
        <br>Tiana likes to observe how the lighting on the sea changes, how the color of the boat is reflected in the water, how the glare of the sun flickers on the waves. The play of light and color. She strives to convey all this in her works. And also the spirit of freedom, wind, freshness and sea breeze!  Breathtaking, isn't it?..</br>
